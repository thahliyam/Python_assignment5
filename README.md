# Python_assignment5
This Python script is a comprehensive collection of exercises aimed at enhancing programming skills in file handling, exception management, and user input validation. It begins with basic file operations such as reading and displaying the contents of a file to the console, followed by copying the contents of one file to another, ensuring users become familiar with handling file streams effectively. Another exercise counts the total number of words in a file, teaching text processing and file manipulation techniques.

The script also includes interactive tasks where the user is prompted to input data. For example, one exercise converts a user-provided string to an integer using try-except blocks to handle invalid inputs gracefully, demonstrating the importance of exception handling. Another task involves validating a list of integers entered by the user, raising an exception if any negative values are found, thereby reinforcing input validation concepts.

Advanced tasks include calculating the average of a user-provided list of integers while using try-except-finally blocks to handle errors and ensure the program completes gracefully, regardless of exceptions. The final exercise focuses on writing a user-provided string to a file, incorporating error handling to manage unexpected issues and providing feedback if the operation succeeds.

Each exercise in this script is carefully designed to cover essential programming techniques, making it an ideal resource for learners looking to strengthen their foundational Python skills in file handling, data validation, and exception management.
